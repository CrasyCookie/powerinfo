Powerinfo v1.1

Usage:
  powerinfo
  powerinfo -h
  powerinfo -cCeEpRstwW CONFIG
Output flags:
  -c              Include battery cycles in output.
  -p              Include battery charge percentage in output.
  -s              Include the charging status in output (Charging/Discharging).
  -t              Include set charging thresholds in output.
  -w              Include current charge out of the maximum charge in output.
  -W              Include maximum charge out of design maximum charge in output.
Control flags:
  -C CONFIG       Use alternate configuration file.
  -e              Ignore errors and issue warnings instead.
  -E              Ignore errors silently.
  -h              Show help.
  -R              Raw output, only output values like 80% and 48.2Wh/57.0Wh.

Running powerinfo without any arguments results in the flags -pcs being used by default.

Output
The output is always sent in a specific order. This order is:
1. Charge percentage
2. Battery cycles
3. Charging status
4. Charging thresholds
5. Current charge out of max charge in watt hours
6. Max charge out of max design charge in watt hours

Example output:
-c
  Battery has gone through 127 charge cycles
-p
  87% Battery left
-s
  Battery is currently discharging
-t
  Charging starts at 85% and stops at 95%
-w
  Battery currently holds 9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  Battery can hold 47.2Wh/57Wh of charge

Example raw output:
-c
  127
-p
  87%
-s
  discharging
-t
  85%-95%
-w
  9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  47.2Wh/57Wh

Configuration:
The default location for a configuration file is /etc/powerinfo.
A configuartion file is not automatically created by the program and is not needed to function.
The configuration file is a shell script that gets executed, and can set the default value of these options:
IGNORE_ERRORS                WARN_ON_ERROR                          OUTPUT_RAW
OUTPUT_PERCENTAGE            OUTPUT_CYCLES                          OUTPUT_STATUS
OUTPUT_THRESHOLDS            OUTPUT_CURRENT_CHARGE_OF_MAX_CHARGE    OUTPUT_MAX_CHARGE_OF_DESIGN_MAX_CHARGE
The value is defined in a 1 or a 0, 1 meaning enabled by default and 0 meaning disabled by default.
Note that these values are currently system-wide and force-enable the flags regardless of additional flags.

Exit statuses:
An exit status of 0 means success.
An exit status of 1 means that some commandline option gave an error.
This program will give an exit status of 2 if it encounters any error where a necessary file doesn't exist.
