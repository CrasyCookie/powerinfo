Powerinfo v1.4

Usage:
  powerinfo
  powerinfo -h
  powerinfo -cCeEpRstwW CONFIG
Output flags:
  -c              Include battery cycles in output.
  -p              Include battery charge percentage in output.
  -s              Include the charging status in output (Charging/Discharging).
  -t              Include set charging thresholds in output.
  -T              Include battery temperature in output.
  -w              Include current charge out of the maximum charge in output.
  -W              Include maximum charge out of design maximum charge in output.
Control flags:
  -B BATTERY      Use alternative battery.
  -C CONFIG       Use alternative configuration file.
  -e              Ignore errors and issue warnings instead.
  -E              Ignore errors silently.
  -h              Display help.
  -R              Raw output, only output values like 80% and 48.2Wh/57.0Wh.
  -v              Display version.

Running powerinfo without any arguments results in the flags -epcs being used by default.

Output
The output is always sent in a specific order. This order is:
1. Charge percentage
2. Battery cycles
3. Charging status
4. Charging thresholds
5. Battery temperature
6. Current charge out of max charge in watt hours
7. Max charge out of max design charge in watt hours

The flags -h and -v are fully exclusive.

Example output:
-c
  Battery has gone through 127 charge cycles
-p
  87% Battery left
-s
  Battery is currently discharging
-t
  Charging starts at 85% and stops at 95%
-T
  Battery temperature is at 43C.
-w
  Battery currently holds 9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  Battery can hold 47.2Wh/57Wh of charge
-v
  Powerinfo v1.3

Example raw output:
-c
  127
-p
  87%
-s
  discharging
-t
  85%-95%
-T
  43C
-w
  9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  47.2Wh/57Wh
-v
  Powerinfo v1.3

About -e and -E.
The flags -e and -E will only apply to flags after them.
For example with the flags -esp the -e flag will apply to both the -s and -p flag.
But with the flags -sep the -e flag will only apply to the -p flag.
You can also use both -e and -E flags, as the -E flag will be checked first.
That means that the flags -sepEt will exit on failure the flag -s, warn on failure of -p and ignore failure of -t.

Configuration:
The default location for a configuration file is /etc/powerinfo.
A configuartion file is not automatically created by the program and is not needed to function.
Using the -C flag will stop the program from reading /etc/powerinfo, and it will instead read the supplied configuartion file.
The configuration file is a shell script that gets executed, and can set the default value of these options:
BATTERY                                   BATTERY_DIRECTORY
IGNORE_ERRORS                             WARN_ON_ERROR
OUTPUT_RAW                                OUTPUT_PERCENTAGE
OUTPUT_CYCLES                             OUTPUT_STATUS
OUTPUT_THRESHOLDS                         OUTPUT_TEMPERATURE
OUTPUT_CURRENT_CHARGE_OF_MAX_CHARGE       OUTPUT_MAX_CHARGE_OF_DESIGN_MAX_CHARGE
The value is defined in a 1 or a 0, 1 meaning enabled and 0 meaning disabled.
Note that these values are currently system-wide and force-enable the flags regardless of additional flags.
It can also define this function to alter the behavior of the program:
empty_flags
See "config" for examples.

Exit statuses:
An exit status of 0 means success.
An exit status of 1 means that some commandline option gave an error.
An exit status of 2 means that a file doesn't exist.
An exit status of 3 means that the selected battery doesn't exist.
An exit status of 4 means that the selected configuration file doesn't exist.
