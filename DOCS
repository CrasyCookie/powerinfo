Powerinfo v1.3

Usage:
  powerinfo
  powerinfo -h
  powerinfo -cCeEpRstwW CONFIG
Output flags:
  -c              Include battery cycles in output.
  -p              Include battery charge percentage in output.
  -s              Include the charging status in output (Charging/Discharging).
  -t              Include set charging thresholds in output.
  -T              Include battery temperature in output.
  -w              Include current charge out of the maximum charge in output.
  -W              Include maximum charge out of design maximum charge in output.
Control flags:
  -C CONFIG       Use alternate configuration file.
  -e              Ignore errors and issue warnings instead.
  -E              Ignore errors silently.
  -h              Display help.
  -R              Raw output, only output values like 80% and 48.2Wh/57.0Wh.
  -v              Display version.

Running powerinfo without any arguments results in the flags -pcs being used by default.

Output
The output is always sent in a specific order. This order is:
1. Charge percentage
2. Battery cycles
3. Charging status
4. Charging thresholds
5. Battery temperature
6. Current charge out of max charge in watt hours
7. Max charge out of max design charge in watt hours

The flags -h and -v stop execution of program.

Example output:
-c
  Battery has gone through 127 charge cycles
-p
  87% Battery left
-s
  Battery is currently discharging
-t
  Charging starts at 85% and stops at 95%
-T
  Battery temperature is at 43C.
-w
  Battery currently holds 9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  Battery can hold 47.2Wh/57Wh of charge
-v

Configuration:
The default location for a configuration file is /etc/powerinfo.
A configuartion file is not automatically created by the program and is not needed to function.
The configuration file is a shell script that gets executed, and can set the default value of these options:
IGNORE_ERRORS                             WARN_ON_ERROR
OUTPUT_RAW                                OUTPUT_PERCENTAGE
OUTPUT_CYCLES                             OUTPUT_STATUS
OUTPUT_THRESHOLDS                         OUTPUT_TEMPERATURE
OUTPUT_CURRENT_CHARGE_OF_MAX_CHARGE       OUTPUT_MAX_CHARGE_OF_DESIGN_MAX_CHARGE
The value is defined in a 1 or a 0, 1 meaning enabled and 0 meaning disabled.
Note that these values are currently system-wide and force-enable the flags regardless of additional flags.

Exit statuses:
An exit status of 0 means success.
An exit status of 1 means that some commandline option gave an error.
An exit status of 2 means that a file doesn't exist.
