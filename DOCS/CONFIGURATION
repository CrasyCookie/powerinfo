Powerinfo v1.4

Configuration:

Powerinfo searches for these config files (in order)
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/powerinfo/config
  $HOME/.config/powerinfo/config
  /etc/powerinfo/config

A configuartion file is not automatically created by the
program and is not needed for normal function.

The configuration file is a shell script that gets executed,
and it can set the default value of these options:
BATTERY                                   BATTERY_DIRECTORY
IGNORE_ERRORS                             WARN_ON_ERROR
OUTPUT_RAW                                OUTPUT_PERCENTAGE
OUTPUT_CYCLES                             OUTPUT_STATUS
OUTPUT_THRESHOLDS                         OUTPUT_TEMPERATURE
OUTPUT_CURRENT_CHARGE_OF_MAX_CHARGE       OUTPUT_MAX_CHARGE_OF_DESIGN_MAX_CHARGE

It can also define this function to alter the behavior of the program:
  empty_flags

See "config" for examples of (almost) all possible values being set.
