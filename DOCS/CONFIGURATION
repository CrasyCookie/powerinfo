Powerinfo v1.4

Configuration:
The default location for a configuration file is /etc/powerinfo.
A configuartion file is not automatically created by the program and is not needed to function.
Using the -C flag will stop the program from reading /etc/powerinfo, and it will instead read the supplied configuartion file.
The configuration file is a shell script that gets executed, and can set the default value of these options:
BATTERY                                   BATTERY_DIRECTORY
IGNORE_ERRORS                             WARN_ON_ERROR
OUTPUT_RAW                                OUTPUT_PERCENTAGE
OUTPUT_CYCLES                             OUTPUT_STATUS
OUTPUT_THRESHOLDS                         OUTPUT_TEMPERATURE
OUTPUT_CURRENT_CHARGE_OF_MAX_CHARGE       OUTPUT_MAX_CHARGE_OF_DESIGN_MAX_CHARGE
The value is defined in a 1 or a 0, 1 meaning enabled and 0 meaning disabled.
Note that these values are currently system-wide and force-enable the flags regardless of additional flags.
It can also define this function to alter the behavior of the program:
empty_flags
See "config" for examples of (almost) all possible values being set.
