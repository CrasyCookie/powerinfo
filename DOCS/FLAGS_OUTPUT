Powerinfo v1.4

FLAGS:
Usage:
  powerinfo
  powerinfo -h
  powerinfo -v
  powerinfo -BcCeEpRstTwW [OPTIONS]
Output flags:
  -c              Include battery cycles in output.
  -p              Include battery charge percentage in output.
  -s              Include the charging status in output (Charging/Discharging).
  -t              Include set charging thresholds in output.
  -T              Include battery temperature in output.
  -w              Include current charge out of the maximum charge in output.
  -W              Include maximum charge out of design maximum charge in output.
Control flags:
  -B BATTERY      Use alternative battery.
  -C CONFIG       Use alternative configuration file.
  -e              Ignore errors and issue warnings instead.
  -E              Ignore errors silently.
  -h              Display help.
  -R              Raw output, only output values like 80% and 48.2Wh/57.0Wh.
  -v              Display version.

Other notes about the flags:
* The flags -h and -v are fully exclusive as they exit the program when they are done.
* Running powerinfo without any arguments results in the flags -epcs being used by default.
* Since my drivers don't support it, the -T flag is currently fully untested, but should work
  according to the ACPI specifications and reference implementation.

About -e and -E. (This information might be incorrect or incoherent.)
The flags -e and -E will only apply to flags after them.
For example with the flags -esp the -e flag will apply to both the -s and -p flag.
But with the flags -sep the -e flag will only apply to the -p flag.
You can also use both -e and -E flags, as the -E flag will be checked first.
That means that the flags -sepEt will exit on failure for the flag -s, warn on failure for -p and ignore failure for -t.


OUTPUT:
The output is always sent in a specific order. This order is:
1. Charge percentage
2. Battery cycles
3. Charging status
4. Charging thresholds
5. Battery temperature
6. Current charge out of max charge in watt hours
7. Max charge out of max design charge in watt hours

Example output:
-c
  Battery has gone through 127 charge cycles
-p
  87% Battery left
-s
  Battery is currently discharging
-t
  Charging starts at 85% and stops at 95%
-T
  Battery temperature is at 43C.
-w
  Battery currently holds 9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  Battery can hold 47.2Wh/57Wh of charge
-v
  Powerinfo v1.3

Example raw output:
-c
  127
-p
  87%
-s
  discharging
-t
  85%-95%
-T
  43C
-w
  9.8Wh/47.2Wh
-W
  47.2Wh/57Wh
-v
  Powerinfo v1.3

Exit statuses:
An exit status of 0 means success.
An exit status of 1 means that some commandline option gave an error.
An exit status of 2 means that a file doesn't exist.
An exit status of 3 means that the selected battery doesn't exist.
An exit status of 4 means that the selected configuration file doesn't exist.
