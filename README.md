# Powerlevel
Created because I just wanted something simply to "Just tell me how much power I have left".
(Should this just be renamed to power?)

Simply reads from the battery how much power is left and reports that back to the user.
Supports different formats using different flags.
Supports number only/without extra text.

## TODO/Roadmap
* Finish roadmap (ofc)
* Decide functionality to add from file tree
* Add flags to control output
* Make sure compatability exists so that nothing breaks if some file isn't found.
 * Find out the difference between `charge_...._threshold` and `charge_control_...._threshold`
* Much more I just don't know yet/rn.
